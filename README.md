# rrassr! (react route server-side rendering)

This project is a node functional programming version of Tyler McGinnis's excellent node class based project.  As such I take very little credit
for it as all the really hard work was already done, I simply used it as an opportunity to have a little play with the isomorphic/universal SSR concept. Oh!  And I gratuitously added redux ... just because... :D

Built on Windows 10 using node 14.6
